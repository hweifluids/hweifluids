<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I work at The Aerodynamics Acoustics & Noise control Technology Centre (AANTC) of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) as a research assistant.

Before joining HKUST, I graduted from CDHAW, Tongji University with a bachelor's degree and honored with outstanding thesis student, under the supervision of Prof. Qing Jia, and serve as a part-time research assistant at Shanghai Automotive Wind Tunnel Center (SAWTC). Then I graduated from Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore with a master's degree with distinction.

My research interest includes aerodynamics and fluid mechanics. On one hand, I employ DNS-based high-order spectral element method (SEM), mainly Nek5000, to solve basic fluid mechanics problems, and on the other hand, I also use commercial CFD tools like Star-CCM+ to simulate engineering cases like automobiles, eVTOLs, and bicycle frameworks. I am also extremly interested in experimental fluid mechanics, especially low-speed wind tunnel. Additionally, I am learning about 3D data-driven tools (DMD, POD, SPOD) and coherent structure identification (FTLE).

I published nothing. I am nobody. (Google Scholar Monitoring <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5szoCzkAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
